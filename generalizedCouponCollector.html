                <p>
                    <!-- INTRO -->
                    Recently, I attended a conference that held a raffle after its evening
                    lectures. The program began early in the morning and went on until 7pm;
                    many attendees had already left by the time the raffle began. This sparked
                    the question:
                    <br><br>
                    <b>In a raffle with a total of \( t \) tickets, 
                        \( p \) of which are held by people still participating, 
                        on average, how many tickets would have to be drawn to 
                        find a winner?</b>
                    <br><br>
                    This first problem was quick, and I solved it in three ways: 
                    using recursion, linearity, and then a satisfying intuitive 
                    argument that led to interesting extensions.
                    <br><br>

                    <!-- RECURSION -->
                    <u>Recursion</u>
                    <br><br>
                    Let \( E_{k} \) represent the expected number of draws to 
                    find a winning ticket when there are \( k \) tickets left in 
                    the hat. Our goal, then, is to determine \(E_{t}\). It is 
                    clear that:
                    <div>
                        \[
                        E_{p} = 1
                        \]
                    </div>
                    since, if we have narrowed down the hat to p tickets, they all 
                    must be valid and only one draw will be needed. We can also see that:
                    <div>
                        \[
                        E_{k} = 1 + \frac{k-p}{k}E_{k-1}
                        \]
                    </div>
                    since after a draw, there is a \(\frac{k-p}{k}\) chance we will get 
                    an invalid ticket and have to redraw. From the first few values, it's 
                    easy to see what \(E_{t}\) equals:
                    <div class="centered-container">
                        <div class="centered-text">
                            \[
                            E_{p} = 1 \\
                            E_{p+1} = 1 + \frac{1}{p+1}E_{p} = \frac{p+2}{p+1} \\
                            E_{p+2} = 1 + \frac{2}{p+2}E_{p+1} = \frac{p+3}{p+1} \\
                            \vdots \\
                            E_{t} = \frac{t+1}{p+1}.
                            \]
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <!-- LINEARITY -->
                    <u>Linearity</u>
                    <br><br>
                    One thing that struck me in this answer was that every additional invalid 
                    ticket increased the expected value by \(\frac{1}{p+1}\). Clearly, this was 
                    because every invalid ticket has a \(\frac{1}{p+1}\) probability of appearing 
                    before all valid tickets, and with linearity and some indicator variables, 
                    it's easy to show that the expectation is simply \(1 + \frac{1}{p+1}(t-p) = 
                    \frac{t+1}{p+1}\).
                    <br><br>

                    <!-- INTUITION -->
                    <u>Intuitive Argument</u>
                    <br><br>
                    Looking at the \(t-p\) term in my new result, I realized that a rephrasing of 
                    this question made the solution almost trivial.
                    <br><br>
                    <b> Define \(l=t-p\) as the number of people that left before the raffle 
                        began. Find the expected number of draws necessary <u>before</u> a winning 
                        ticket is found.
                    </b>
                    <br><br>
                    This simple rewording helped me visualize this question very differently. 
                    Imagine that we're assembling a full sequence of draws. If we have \(p\) 
                    valid tickets, then we can place the remaining \(l\) invalid tickets either 
                    at the front, between valid tickets, or at the end. In effect, there are 
                    \(p+1\) 'holes' to be filled in with the \(l\) invalid tickets. 
                    Thus, on average, each hole will get \(\frac{l}{p+1}\) tickets. 
                    This of course means that, at the beginning of our sequence, on average we 
                    expect to see \(\frac{l}{p+1}\) invalid tickets before finding a winner.
                    <br><br>
                    To match the answer to our original question, we simply add 1 to this 
                    expectation to account for the final draw of picking the winning ticket.
                    <br><br>

                    <!-- TESTING 1 -->
                    <u> Testing My Expectation</u>
                    <br><br>
                    Though the multiple derivations convinced me that my work was correct, 
                    I wanted to see it in practice. To do this, I ran simulations using 
                    Python. Here, I am finding the number of draws before a winning ticket 
                    is found, as I considered in the intuitive solution.
                    <br><br>
                    I initialized \(t\) and \(p\) to arbitrary numbers and ran 20,000 trials, 
                    tracking the number of draws in every simulation and updating my average. 
                    After trying multiple values of \(t\) and \(p\), it was clear from my plots that 
                    my formula was correct; the experimental averages indeed converged to my 
                    predicted result.

                    <br>

                    <!-- 2 COLORS -->
                    <u>Extension to 2 Colors</u>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Suppose, for some reason, we want to see both a valid and invalid ticket. Equivalently, 
                        say we are drawing balls of 2 colors out of an urn without replacement and want to see both 
                        colors. On average, if we start with \(a\) amber balls and \(b\) blue balls, how many draws without 
                        replacement are needed before seeing both colors?
                    </b>
                    <br><br>
                    This is actually a simple extension of the last problem. There are 2 cases: if we draw an amber ball 
                    last, we expect to see \(\frac{b}{a+1}\) blue balls before success. Similarly, if we draw a blue ball 
                    last, we expect to see \(\frac{a}{b+1}\) amber balls beforehand. The arguments for each are identical 
                    to the previous intuitive argument.
                    <br><br>
                    Since these cases are mutually exclusive, it is easy to see that our new answer is simply the sum 
                    of both expectations we calculated:
                    <div>
                        \[
                        \frac{a}{b+1} + \frac{b}{a+1}.
                        \]
                    </div>
                    Whereas before, if we got a valid ticket we stopped drawing, now, regardless of whichever type we 
                    get first, we must keep drawing. Thus, we expect an increase from our last answer, and this result 
                    seems to make sense.
                    <br><br>
                    <u>Testing the 2 Colors Case</u>
                    <br><br>
                    I modified my previous simulation to take in values for \(a\) and \(b\) to determine how many draws are 
                    necessary before finding both colors. Once again, the experimental average converged to the results 
                    of my expected value calculations.

                    <!-- 3 COLORS -->
                    <u>Extension to 3 Colors</u>
                    <br><br>
                    <b> Now, we have \(a\) amber balls, \(b\) blue balls, and \(c\) copper balls in an 
                        urn. On average, how many draws must be made without replacement before drawing balls of all colors?
                    </b>
                    <br><br>
                    This problem was harder to tackle. My instinct was that a quick extension of what I had done in the case of 
                    2 colors wouldn't work. This time, the last color to appear could not define the entire progression of colors; 
                    thus my cases, as I defined them, were no longer mutually exclusive.
                    <br><br>
                    I tested my theory experimentally. For \(a\) amber balls, \(b\) blue balls, and \(c\) copper balls, I tried:
                    <div>
                        \[
                        \frac{a+b}{c+1} + \frac{a+c}{b+1} + \frac{b+c}{a+1}.
                        \]
                    </div>
                    Sure enough, the experimental data showed this approach was wrong. My formula was overshooting the true 
                    expected value.
                    <figure class="image-container">
                        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/expwrong.png') }}" alt="first graph of expectation 2">
                    </figure>
                    <figcaption>This formula was wrong, above the true value by over 1.25 in this case.</figcaption>
                    <br>
                    Looking at my formula, I saw that I was considering sets of 2 colors based on the last color. But what if 
                    I also had to consider sets of a single color before the other 2?
                    <br><br>
                    One way to think about it is, regardless of the sequence of colors you draw from the urn, you can reorganize 
                    them into 3 groups: those of the first color seen, those of the second, and the single ball from the third 
                    and final color. The sequences don't really matter because we're counting the total number of draws, and on 
                    average, we expect a constant number of balls in each group.
                    Let's take the case of an amber ball coming out first or second. From this new perspective, it's clear that 
                    the \(\frac{a+b}{c+1} + \frac{a+c}{b+1}\) contribution to our sum is overcounting the expected number of amber balls. 
                    If we envision keeping the amber group at the front, it's clear that we overcounted the expected number of amber balls 
                    appearing before blue and copper balls. Quantified, we overcounted by \(\frac{a}{b+c+1}\). Extending this logic to the 
                    other colors, we have:
                    <div class="centered-container">
                        <div class="centered-text">
                            \[
                            \frac{a+b}{c+1} + \frac{a+c}{b+1} + \frac{b+c}{a+1} \\
                            - \frac{a}{b+c+1} - \frac{b}{a+c+1} - \frac{c}{a+b+1}.
                            \]
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    
                    <u>Testing the 3 Colors Case</u>
                    <br><br>
                    This time, the simulations showed my formula was correct. Indeed, correcting for overcounting by considering 1 
                    color relative to the other 2 shifted the expectation down the correct amount.

                    <u>Generalizing to N Colors</u>
                    <br><br>
                    Now, things were getting interesting. I was seeing something like the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (PIE) 
                    being used in a problem similar to the coupon collector problem. However, rather than drawing from an infinite 
                    pool with constant probabilities, here I was drawing from a finite urn. After figuring out the application of 
                    PIE in the case of 3 colors, extending to \(n\) colors wasn't too difficult. Let's state the problem in 
                    its extended form:

                        In an urn, we have balls of \(n\) colors, with a total of \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} b_{i} = B\) balls, where \(b_{i}\) signifies
                        the number of balls of the \(i^{th}\) color. What is the expected number of draws required before seeing 
                        all \(n\) colors?

                    Let \(U = \{1, 2,\dots,n\}\). A straightforward extension of my answer from the cases of 2 and 3 colors yielded:
                    <div>
                        \[
                        \sum_{S \subseteq U, S \neq \emptyset} (-1)^{|S|-1}\frac{B - \sum_{i \in S} b_{i}}{\sum_{i \in S} b_{i} + 1}.
                        \]
                    </div>
                    Written another way, we have:
                    <div>
                        \[
                        \sum_{S \subseteq U, S \neq \emptyset} (-1)^{|S|-1}\frac{\sum_{i \in S^C} b_{i}}{\sum_{i \in S} b_{i} + 1}.
                        \]
                    </div>

                    Once again, we see excellent convergence to predicted results. It's worth noting that, due to the exponential 
                    time complexity of working with all subsets of \(U\), \(n\) needs to be limited to around 25 or under.

                        A final challenge to address: We've now found how many draws are needed on average before seeing all 
                        \(n\) colors, even with varying the numbers of balls of each color. But now, how do we calculate the expectation
                        of draws before we see \(k\) out of \(n\) distinct colors?
                    </b>
                    <br><br>
                    The key insight is to realize that the process of computing this expectation is very similar to any PIE 
                    calculation where we calculate the number of elements in at least \(k\) of \(n\) sets, but with a bit of a twist.
                    <br><br>
                    First, we need to define some helpful terminology. In the last expectation formula, notice that values are positive 
                    or negative depending on the cardinality of \(S\). This is common in PIE calculations, and we can in fact group these 
                    partial sums by the cardinalities of \(S\) being considered. For instance, we'll calculate the sum for all subsets \(S\) 
                    of length 1, then \(2\), and so on, keeping the absolute values of these quantities. Let's call these values \(v_1\), 
                    \(v_2\), etc.
                    <br><br>
                    When solving a problem of this "at least \(k\) out of \(n\)" form, the only things that change are the coefficients of 
                    each \(v_i\), and the starting point of the alternating sum. As is well known, for this particular PIE problem we 
                    always see coefficients of the form:
                    <div>
                        \[
                        {i-1 \choose k-1}.
                        \]
                    </div>
                    However, in this case, we can't simply map these coefficients over to our problem. In our last expectation formula, 
                    we were computing the number of draws required before seeing all colors. Essentially, we had the case of \(k=n\), 
                    and the calculation was analogous to computing the number of elements in at least 1 subset. Interestingly, 
                    we are not constructing our expectation based on seen colors, but rather based on unseen colors still in the 
                    urn. We need to adjust our coefficients accordingly.
                    <br><br>
                    Thus, we see that when we have \(k=n-1\), we are performing a calculation analogous to computing the number of 
                    elements in at least 2 subsets. Extending this, when we have an arbitrary \(k\), we're finding the number of 
                    elements in at least \(n-k+1\) sets. Therefore, our coefficients are of the form:
                    <div>
                        \[
                        {i-1 \choose n-k}.
                        \]
                    </div>
                    So, for \(k=n-2\), we have \(v_3 - 3v_4 + 6v_5 - ...\), etc.
                    <br><br>
                    Further, we see that \(i = |S|\), and the choice of which values are positive and which are negative is 
                    dependent upon \(n\), \(k\), and \(|S|\). Together, we have our expected value expression:
                    <div class="centered-container">
                        <div class="centered-text">
                            \[
                            \sum_{S \subseteq U, S \neq \emptyset} (-1)^{n+k+|S|+1}{|S|-1 \choose n-k}\frac{\sum_{i \in S^C} b_{i}}{\sum_{i \in S} b_{i} + 1}.
                            \]
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <br><br>
                    Once again, testing shows that the derived expression works incredibly well to predict the experimental results, 
                    i.e., I've found a working solution to the generalized coupon collector without replacement problem.

                    While I don't have rigorous proofs, I think there's sufficient intuition/evidence behind my work for the 
                    purposes of this blog. I used Python in a Jupyter notebook, and I've put up the code on my
